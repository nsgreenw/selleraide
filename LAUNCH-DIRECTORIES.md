## Submission Strategy
1. **Week 1:** Tier 3 + AI directories (low effort, start building backlinks)
2. **Week 2:** Tier 2 (BetaList needs early submission)
3. **Week 3:** Tier 1 (Product Hunt launch day — coordinate with Reddit + HN + Indie Hackers for max impact)

## Notes
- Product Hunt launch should be coordinated — pick a Tuesday/Wednesday, rally upvotes
- Reddit posts should be authentic "I built this" energy, NOT salesy
- Each directory is a permanent backlink — compounds forever
- Reuse the same copy/assets across all submissions
- After SellerAide, do the same for every Pikewood app
