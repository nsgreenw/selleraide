## Phase 1: Immediate Traction (Weeks 1–4)

### 1A. Reddit — Free, High-Intent Traffic

**Target subreddits** (by priority):

| Subreddit | Members | Action |
|---|---|---|
| r/FulfillmentByAmazon | 200K+ | Comment on listing optimization threads, share QA scoring insights |
| r/AmazonSeller | 63K | Answer "how to write better listings" questions |
| r/ecommerce | 177K | Post about multi-marketplace listing challenges |
| r/Shopify | 100K | Help with product description optimization |
| r/reseller | Active | eBay listing tips, mention the free Chrome extension |

**Strategy**: Don't spam links. Provide genuinely useful listing advice (banned terms to avoid, character limit tips, A+ Content structure). Mention SellerAide naturally when relevant. The **free Chrome extension** is your best conversion wedge — it requires no signup.

**Sample post template**:
> "I built a free Chrome extension that scores your Amazon/eBay listings 0-100 and flags banned terms that cause silent suppression. No signup needed. [link] — would love feedback from sellers here."

### 1B. Chrome Extension as Top-of-Funnel

Your extension is your strongest acquisition lever:
- **Free, no auth required** — zero friction
- Delivers instant value (QA score in seconds)
- Natural upsell path: "Want to fix these issues? Generate an optimized listing →"

**Actions**:
- Submit to Chrome Web Store if not already listed
- Create a short demo video (30-60 seconds) showing: install → navigate to Amazon listing → one-click audit → see score + issues
- Post the extension in every relevant community as a free tool

### 1C. Discord Communities

| Server | Members | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| AmazonFBA Discord | 23K+ | Share listing tips in #listing-optimization channel |
| FBA Group | Active | Offer free audits to build credibility |
| Next Level Resell | Active | eBay-focused; demo the extension |
| Part Time Resellers | Active | Multi-platform angle |

---

## Phase 2: Content & SEO (Weeks 2–8)

### 2A. Blog Content Targeting Seller Pain Points

Create 5–10 blog posts targeting long-tail keywords sellers are actively searching:

| Article | Target Keyword | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| "Amazon Banned Words List 2026" | amazon banned words | Compliance pain → extension CTA |
| "How to Write Amazon Bullet Points That Convert" | amazon bullet points | Listing quality → tool CTA |
| "eBay Listing Template: Complete Guide" | ebay listing template | eBay sellers → multi-marketplace pitch |
| "Amazon Listing Suppressed? Here's Why" | amazon listing suppressed | Suppression recovery → QA scorer CTA |
| "Amazon vs eBay Listing Requirements Compared" | amazon vs ebay listing | Multi-marketplace sellers → differentiator |
| "A+ Content Guide: Modules That Convert" | amazon a+ content guide | Brand owners → Pro tier CTA |

### 2B. YouTube — Demo & Tutorial Content

**3 videos to produce first**:
1. "I Scored 100 Amazon Listings — Here's What I Found" (data-driven, shareable)
2. "Free Tool: Audit Any Amazon/eBay Listing in 10 Seconds" (extension demo)
3. "AI vs Manual Listing Writing: Side-by-Side Comparison" (SellerAide vs ChatGPT vs manual)

---

## Phase 3: Partnerships (Weeks 4–12)

### 3A. FBA Prep Centers (Highest Value)

Sellers at prep centers are actively launching products — they need listings *right now*.

| Company | Pitch |
|---|---|
| AMZ Prep | "Offer listing optimization as an add-on service, powered by our API" |
| ShipBob | "Bundle listing creation with fulfillment onboarding" |
| Shipfusion | Co-branded landing page: "Your product is prepped — now optimize your listing" |

**Partnership model**: Revenue share (20–30%) or flat referral fee ($5–10/signup).

### 3B. Listing Agencies (White-Label)

Agencies charge $500–5,000 per listing optimization. SellerAide at $49/mo for 200 listings is a 10x cost reduction for them.

| Agency | Pitch |
|---|---|
| Canopy Management | White-label Agency tier; they bill clients, SellerAide powers output |
| SalesDuo | "Generate first drafts in minutes, your team refines" |
| Signalytics | Complement their keyword data with AI generation |

### 3C. Cross-Listing Tools (API Integration)

These tools publish listings across marketplaces but don't generate optimized content:

| Tool | Integration Pitch |
|---|---|
| Vendoo | "SellerAide generates, Vendoo publishes" |
| List Perfectly | Content quality layer for their cross-listing workflow |
| Crosslist | Browser extension partnership (both are extensions) |

### 3D. Course Creators & Influencers (Affiliate)

Offer 20–30% recurring commission:

| Creator | Platform | Audience | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steven Pope (My Amazon Guy) | YouTube (50K+) | Amazon SEO-focused | Sponsor a video; he reviews listing tools regularly |
| Trevin Peterson | YouTube/Community (425K) | FBA beginners | Affiliate deal + student discount |
| Bradley Sutton | Serious Sellers Podcast | Advanced sellers | Podcast sponsorship ($500–2K/episode) |
| Kathy Terrill | eBay podcast | eBay sellers | eBay-specific demo |
| Kurt Elster | Unofficial Shopify Podcast | Shopify merchants | Multi-marketplace angle |

## Market Context

### Key Data Points
- AI in e-commerce market: $9.01B (2025) → $74.93B (2035) at 23.59% CAGR
- 34% of Amazon sellers already use AI for listing optimization (#1 AI use case)
- 100K+ sellers have used Amazon's own native AI listing tools
- Amazon Rufus AI influencing 13.7% of searches, projected 25–35% by end of 2025
- Listings take 1–2+ hours manually; cross-marketplace compounds this dramatically

### Seller Pain Points (from community research)
1. **Time**: Writing one good listing takes 1–2+ hours; large catalogs are a bottleneck
2. **Cross-marketplace complexity**: Different rules, character limits, banned terms per platform
3. **Keyword-to-copy balance**: SEO-optimized AND human-readable copy is hard
4. **Silent suppression**: Missing fields, banned terms cause takedowns with no warning
5. **Generic AI output**: ChatGPT/Jasper require expertise and produce non-compliant copy

### Direct Competitors
- **Perci AI** ($29–79/mo) — Amazon + Walmart, no QA scoring, no chat workflow
- **CopyMonkey** ($49–99/mo) — Amazon only, keyword focus
- **Snap2List** ($15–39/mo) — eBay only, photo-based
- **Describely** ($9–28/mo) — Shopify/Amazon, content only, no QA
- **Helium 10** ($79–279/mo) — Amazon suite, listing AI is secondary feature
- **Jungle Scout** ($49–149/mo) — Amazon suite, listing AI is secondary feature

### Where Sellers Hang Out
- **Reddit**: r/FulfillmentByAmazon (200K+), r/AmazonSeller (63K), r/ecommerce (177K), r/Shopify (100K)
- **Discord**: AmazonFBA Discord (23K+), FBA Group, Next Level Resell, Part Time Resellers
- **Facebook**: Amazon Sellers Community (54.8K), MySilentTeam (75.8K)
- **Podcasts**: Serious Sellers (Helium 10), My Amazon Guy, Full-Time FBA Show, Seller Sessions
- **YouTube**: My Amazon Guy (50K), Trevin Peterson (425K community), Jungle Scout, Helium 10

*The Chrome extension is your unfair advantage. Every competitor requires signup/payment before the user sees value. You give value for free in 10 seconds. Lead with that everywhere.*
